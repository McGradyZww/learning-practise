Shar's Birthday:
The birthday is October 6th, but the party will be Saturday,
October 5.  It's my 24th birthday and the first one in some 
years for which I've been employed.  Plus, I have new clothes.
So I have cause to celebrate.  More importantly, though, 
we've cleaned the house!  The address is 506-D Albert Street.
Extra enticement for CS geeks:  there are several systems in
the house, and the party is conveniently scheduled for 3 hours
after the second CSC programming contest ends (not to mention,
within easy walking distance)!

Sample Output
