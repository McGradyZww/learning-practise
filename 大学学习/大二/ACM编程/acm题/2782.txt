If you have ever read Harry Potter, you would know that the evil and powerful wizard, Lord Voldemort, create this name by permuting his original name, "Tom Marvolo Riddle", to "I am Lord Voldemort". 
Write a program to check whether it is possible to transform a given word to another by permuting its letters. 


Input
The first line is an integer T, the number of test cases. Following T lines each contains two words separated by spaces. 

Output
For each test case, Output on a line "Yes" if it is possible to do the transformation, otherwise output "No" instead. 

Notes
Permuting a word is to change the order of its letters, but no new letters can be added and no original letters can be deleted. For example, one can transform "aabc" to "abca", but not to "bac", "abc", "aabca", "aacbb". 
Words will contain letters only('a'-'z', 'A'-'Z'). 
A word won't contain any white spaces in itself. 
The given two words will not be the same. 
You should ignore case when comparing words, i.e. 'a' is the same as 'A', 'b' is the same as 'B', etc. 
Constraints
The length of any given word is greater than 0 and no larger than 50.
