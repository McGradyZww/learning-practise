Poor Bessie has taken a job in the convenience store located just over the border in Slobbovia. Slobbovians use different coinages than the USA; their coin values change day-by-day! 
Help Bessie make optimal change for Slobbovian shoppers. You will need to create C (1 ¡Ü C ¡Ü 1000) cents of change using N (1 ¡Ü N ¡Ü 10) coins of various values. All test cases will be solvable using the supplied coins. 
If 5 coins of values 50, 25, 10, 5, and 1 were available, Bessie would make optimum change (minimal coins) of 93 cents by using 1 x 50, 1 x 25, 1 x 10, 1 x 5, and 3 x 1 coins (a total of 7 coins). 
How hard could it be? The final two test cases will be challenging. 
Input
* Line 1: Two space-separate integers: C and N 
* Lines 2..N + 1: Each line contains a single unique integer that is a coin value that can be used to create change 
Output
* Line 1: A single integer that is the minimum number of coins to create C cents
