In sixth grade, students are presented with different ways to calculate the Least Common Multiple (LCM) and the Greatest Common Factor (GCF) of two integers. The LCM of two integers a and b is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both a and b. The GCF of two non-zero integers a and b is the largest positive integer that divides both a and b without remainder. 
For this problem you will write a program that determines both the LCM and GCF for positive integers. 

Input
The first line of input contains a single integer N, (1 ¡Ü N ¡Ü 1000) which is the number of data sets that follow. Each data set consists of a single line of input containing two positive integers, a and b, (1 ¡Ü a,b ¡Ü 1000) separated by a space. 
Output
For each data set, you should generate one line of output with the following values: The data set number as a decimal integer (start counting at one), a space, the LCM, a space, and the GCF.
