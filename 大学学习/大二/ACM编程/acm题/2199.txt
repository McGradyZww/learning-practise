You know that the first problem of an online judge system should be the "A+B Problem", but TOJ not. What a terrible! So now it comes... 
Given a series of numbers, your task is to find the largest number C in the sequence, which is the sum of two other numbers A and B in the sequence. Please note that A and B may have the same value, but cannot be the same number. 
Input
The first line of each test case is an integer N (1 ¡Ü N ¡Ü 1000), which is the amount of the numbers, followed by a line of N numbers. 
You can assume all the numbers in the sequence are positive and not more than 108. 
The input will be terminated by a zero. 
Output
Output one line for each test case, indicating the largest number. If there is no such number, output "-1".
