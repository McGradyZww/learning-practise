Given a sequence which contains n elements, we can get its "Sub"-sequence by taking the difference between each pair of adjacent elements. For instance, the original sequence is a1, a2... an, and its "Sub"-sequence is b1, b2... bn-1, where bi = ai+1 - ai.
Now we iteratively apply the above process several times until there is only one element in the sequence. Please write a program to calculate the last element left in the "Sub"-sequence.
Input:
There are several test cases in the input data. The first line contains the number of test cases. There are two lines in each test case. The first line contains a positive integer N (1 ¡Ü N ¡Ü 20) denoting the length of the original sequence. The second line contains a sequence of N elements separated by spaces. It is guaranteed that the absolute value of every element will not exceed 100.
Output:
Output the last element left in the "Sub"-sequence in one line for every test case.
